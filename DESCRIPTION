Description: The centralization of mathematical methods in a single computational platform is essential for fisheries research. The rPesca package in R language gathers routines for age, growth, and mortality analysis of fishery resources, using limited data such as age and length. This information is crucial for the management of artisanal and industrial fisheries, enabling the integration of results and enhancing decision-making processes.
